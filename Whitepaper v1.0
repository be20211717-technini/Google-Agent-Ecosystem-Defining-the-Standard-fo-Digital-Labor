# Google Agent Ecosystem (GAE)
**Whitepaper v1.0**  
The Operating System for Digital Labor  

**Date**: November 2025  
**Authors**: GAE Architecture Working Group  
**Status**: General Availability Proposal  

## 1. Executive Summary  
The next era of the internet is not about finding information — it is about distributing action.  

The Google Agent Ecosystem (GAE) proposes the transition from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to **Service-as-Labor (SaaL)**. Instead of licensing tools, we deliver verified outcomes. Powered by Gemini 3 Pro as its native kernel and governed by the open G-Agent Protocol (GAP), GAE establishes a global, trust-first marketplace for autonomous digital labor.

## 2. Design Principles  
- **Action over information** – Value is created through execution, not conversation.  
- **Outcome over subscription** – Compensation is tied to results, not seats or time.  
- **Protocol over platform** – GAP is an enforceable standard, not a walled garden.

## 3. Technical Architecture  

### 3.1 G-Agent Protocol (GAP)  
A minimal, auditable JSON Schema that defines every agent with three immutable pillars:  
1. **Identity** – Cryptographic signing + Developer KYA  
2. **Contract** – Explicit token budget and pricing model  
3. **Boundary** – Declarative permission manifest (zero trust by default)

### 3.2 Gemini 3 Pro Kernel  
Gemini evolves from model to operating system kernel:  
- Unified reasoning runtime for all agents  
- Pre-execution Gatekeeper (10 ms hallucination & privilege escalation guard)  
- gVisor-based sandbox isolation per agent invocation

## 4. Economic Model – From SaaS to SaaL  

| Tier | Model           | Settlement            | Example                     |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| L1   | Utility         | Pay-per-call          | Translation, OCR            |
| L2   | Pro             | Subscription          | Legal advisor, fitness coach|
| L3   | Outcome         | Revenue share on success | $KILLER refund agent        |

Settlement occurs natively on GAE Ledger (no third-party custodians).  
Developer profit = (Value_created × Commission_rate) − Compute_cost − Insurance_premium

## 5. Governance – AgentRank  
A transparent, Darwinian reputation system:  
AgentRank = (Success × log(Complexity)) / (Error_rate + ε) × Safety_score  

- ≥ 90 → Google Choice badge + elevated permissions (e.g. finance.write)  
- < 60 → Automatic throttling or deprecation  
- Global Kill Switch reserved for red-line safety violations

## 6. Security & Compliance  
- Legacy non-GAP agents are physically blocked at the API gateway  
- High-reputation agents may earn autonomous permissions with full audit trail  
- Mandatory algorithmic insurance pool for outcome-tier agents

## 7. Roadmap  
- **Phase 1 (GA now)** – GAP v1 standardization & registry launch  
- **Phase 2 (Q1 2026)** – Inter-Agent Protocol (agents hiring agents)  
- **Phase 3 (Q3 2026)** – Singularity Market: closed-loop goal-to-outcome automation
